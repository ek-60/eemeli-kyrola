          <p>
            I’m a full stack developer focused on building clean, fast and scalable
            digital experiences. My work spans the full stack — from intuitive frontend
            interfaces to robust backend logic, complex integrations and reliable
            DevOps pipelines.
          </p>

          <p>
            I currently lead the development and continuous improvement of one of the
            most visited websites in Finland. This includes modernizing its architecture,
            maintaining critical integrations and ensuring the platform remains performant,
            stable and accessible for a large and diverse user base.
          </p>

          <p>
            My approach is component-driven on the frontend and integration-driven on the
            backend, supported by automation and consistency across environments. I prioritize
            minimalism, accessibility and maintainability — keeping interfaces light, code
            reusable and systems predictable to operate.
          </p>

          <p>
            I enjoy refining complex systems into something that feels simple — both to build
            and to use.
